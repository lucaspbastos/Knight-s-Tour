# CS 114 Knight's Tour
This project implements the [Knight's Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight's_tour) problem recursively in Java for Fall 2019 CS 114 taught by Professor Kapleau. This is for archival purposes and should not be used for any students currently taking CS 114.

## Setup
The program can be ran by first compiling the Java program with `javac KnightsTour.java` and then running with `java KnightsTour`. The program is set with _m_ = _n_ = 8, but _m_ and _n_ can be changed in lines 7 and 8.
